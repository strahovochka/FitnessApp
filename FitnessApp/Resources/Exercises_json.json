Starting from the top allows the muscles to contract and prepare for work. \n\nLean your torso forward, then slowly lower yourself between the bars, bending your arms at the elbows. It's important to resist gravity on the way down; otherwise, you may injure the chest muscle where it attaches to the shoulder blade or elbow joint. The upper part of the chest muscles should only slightly rise above the bars. This full stretch allows you to extend your shoulder sections far back, thereby fully activating the major chest muscles. \n\nAfter a two-second pause in the stretched position, you're ready to rise up. Your elbows should point sideways if you're targeting the chest muscles. Your palms will be turned inward, and the chest muscles will try to stabilize and pull the shoulder sections towards the centerline of the body (adduction of arms). Thus, you'll activate the middle and lower sections of the chest muscles more than if the elbows were pointing backward. Additionally, you should maintain a forward torso lean (chin to chest) to increase the load on the lower chest regions. \n\nOnce you've reached the stretched position at the bottom, you can rise fairly quickly. However, if you're not very flexible and haven't achieved this stretch before, don't do it! Rise slowly and steadily, straightening your elbows.

Neglecting the precision of technical execution means exposing the trainee to the risk of injury and lack of progress, which almost always leads to the failure of all or part of the training program. \n\nGrip width on the bar: hands, positioned slightly wider than shoulders, hold the bar as if throttling a motorcycle. Thumbs lock the bar; palms, wrists, and forearms are aligned in a straight line. Elbows slightly behind and pointing downward. \n\nBar position on the back: the bar rests on the rear part of the trapezius muscles, shoulder blades are brought together, forming an ideal 'stand' in the rear part of the deltoid muscle. \n\nFoot position: may vary but is always identical on both sides. It is recommended to assume a comfortable and symmetrical position. \n\nUnracking the bar: before unracking, the bar is positioned slightly below the shoulder line when the athlete stands beside it. \n\nUnracking: done by lifting from a seated position under the bar while maintaining a plank position. Once the bar is unracked, step back, remaining close to the rack. \n\nHead position: the head continues the spinal line; the athlete fixes the gaze direction straight ahead. \n\nLeg bending: simultaneously tense the knees and thighs to slightly lower the center of gravity. Keep the abdomen flat, avoiding excessive arching of the lower back. Lower the hip joint to a certain level, depending on the chosen type of squat - full or partial. Knees are in line with thighs and feet. Heels press into the floor. \n\nLeg straightening: knee, thigh, and torso extension should occur synchronously, avoiding knee valgus. The ascent should be symmetrical and without pauses. \n\nCritical moment: when the thigh and shin bone form a right angle, muscle tension reaches its maximum. At this moment, the movement line should be ideal. \n\nExecution speed: there are many techniques. Generally, descent should be controlled, and the search for execution speed mostly happens during ascent. \n\nBreathing: inhale at the beginning of descent, then sharply exhale at the end of ascent. Throughout the exercise, the coach will pay doubled attention to the position of the back and control the pelvic tilt forward, which guarantees the preservation of natural curves (rounding of the back is unacceptable and should lead to changes in the 'cleanliness of execution').",

You can do single-leg calf raises without additional weight or holding a dumbbell in your hand. In any case, the weight should be such that you perform the exercise only with the help of the calf muscles, without involving other leg muscles (this is when the legs bend at the knee joint at the bottom and straighten at the top - this can be seen quite often) and trapezius. That is, it's not worth chasing heavy weights, but it's worth making sure that the knees don't bend and the shoulders remain immobile.",

A controlled quarter squat provides the necessary effort to initiate the movement. Feet are firmly pressed to the ground, emphasis on the base of the foot. Throughout the movement, the plank of the shoulder girdle and torso should be impeccable, while the glutes play a major role in braking during descent and stabilizing the pelvis.\n\nThe pushing phase allows slipping under the barbell through a lunge. Pushing the barbell during the 'explosion,' the athlete essentially throws their body down so that they end up in a lunge position with arms stretched upward. Then comes a new position of full plank to balance the barbell and body, combining concentric triceps and deltoid muscle resistance with isometric locking. The barbell is fixed slightly behind the head. The front leg is pressed into the floor to stabilize the position, while the angles formed by the front and back thighs are more than 90Â°. Avoid turning the heel of the trailing leg outward, which leads to opening the arch of the foot. It's important to keep the pelvis in a forward tilt.\n\nReturning to the standing position before lowering the barbell to the ground occurs first by pulling back the front leg, and then by advancing the back leg.",
